# Twitter-data-wrangling
This is my 4th project on wrangling of data as a Udacity Student pursuing the Data Analyst Nanodegree program.
This is very challenging and fun project about the WeRateDogs Twitter account. Here, I performed the wrangling of the data in three 
sections namely, gather, assess and cleaning of the data. Finally combining the individual pieces of the clean data into one master 
dataset. This was then used for analyses. Other files included are about the wrangling efforts I made to do the afforementioned tasks.
And a .html file to view the concise report of visualizations.
